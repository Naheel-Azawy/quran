  why compress when you can gzip from server
* UI/UX
  - [ ] text is too small for large tablet screen
  - [ ] handle back button on android
  - [ ] tell the user how to show tafseer
  - [ ] replace laggy page animations movement with some kind of scrolling
  - [ ] tafseer drop down remove selected item
  - [ ] color selected aya
  - [ ] show tafseer options on aya click
  - [ ] add search icon
