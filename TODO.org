  why compress when you can gzip from server
* UI/UX
  - [ ] text is too small for large tablet screen
  - [ ] handle back button on android
  - [ ] tell the user how to show tafseer
  - [ ] replace laggy page animations movement with some kind of scrolling
  - [ ] tafseer drop down remove selected item
  - [ ] color selected aya
  - [ ] show tafseer options on aya click
  - [ ] add search icon
* check what pages need -ve word spacing
  - if not too many, manage by hand
  - check when the sura name is on the previous page
* add tatweel instead of word spacing in web ui
* seperate core and reduce json
  remove all details for each aya and compute them when needed
  - [ ] remove simple text
    build an algo to generate simple out of complex. maybe check tanzil
